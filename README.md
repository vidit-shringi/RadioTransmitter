# RadioTransmitter
This is full flash code to create you own FM server or fm transmitter 
# Detail About code 
A shell script that compiles the pifmrds program and then runs a Python script to record audio from the microphone and transmit it as an FM signal.
 this script to a file, make it executable using chmod +x script.sh, and then run it using ./script.sh.
 this script2 to a file, make it executable using chmod +x script2.sh, and then run it using ./script2.sh.

Please note that transmitting radio signals without a license can be illegal in many areas, including the United States and Europe. You should check the regulations in your country before using this code. Also, this is a very basic example and might not work perfectly. For real applications, you would need to handle exceptions, manage resources properly, and probably use a more efficient method for transmitting the audio data.




Also, please note that Tkinter is a Python library for creating GUIs. Bootstrap is a CSS framework for designing websites and web applications, and itâ€™s not directly applicable to Python GUIs. If you want to make your Tkinter GUI more attractive, you can use custom themes and styles, or use a library like ttkthemes.
