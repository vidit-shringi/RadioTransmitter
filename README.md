# RadioTransmitter
This is full flash code to create you own FM server or fm transmitter 
# Detail About code 
A shell script that compiles the pifmrds program and then runs a Python script to record audio from the microphone and transmit it as an FM signal.
 this script to a file, make it executable using chmod +x script.sh, and then run it using ./script.sh.

Please note that transmitting radio signals without a license can be illegal in many areas, including the United States and Europe. You should check the regulations in your country before using this code. Also, this is a very basic example and might not work perfectly. For real applications, you would need to handle exceptions, manage resources properly, and probably use a more efficient method for transmitting the audio data.
